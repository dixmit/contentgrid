Once we have the configuration made, the links will be done automatically.

All integrated documents will have the contentgrid icon on the attachment:

![ContentGrid Attachment](../static/img/contentgrid_attachment.png)

If you press the icon, a popup will be launched showing the information of it in contentgrid and a link to the app:

![ContentGrid Popup](../static/img/contentgrid_popup.png)

Also, related records will show the same icon in the thread menu and will allow us to check the data sent to ContentGrid.

![ContentGrid Thread](../static/img/contentgrid_thread.png)

In case we want to force the send, we can do it manually by using the *Allow manual send* field on the configuration.
This will show a button that sends the data to content grid (only attachments not sent)
